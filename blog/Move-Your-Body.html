    <h1>Move Your Body, Move Your Soul</h1>
    <img src="../assets/colorwaves.png" alt="Move Your Body" />

    <p>There are days when your mind feels foggy, your heart feels disconnected, and your energy is just… off. You try to push through with willpower or distract yourself with tasks, but nothing quite hits.  
    And then—you move. You go for a walk. You dance. You stretch. You lift.  
    And something shifts.</p>

    <p>Movement isn’t just physical. It’s emotional. It’s spiritual. It’s deeply human.  
    We weren’t made to sit still through stress. We were built to release it through movement.</p>

    <h2>The Body Holds What the Mind Tries to Forget</h2>
    <p>We store everything—stress, trauma, frustration, even joy—in the body.  
    Your shoulders tighten with pressure. Your jaw clenches with unspoken words.  
    Your chest sinks with the weight of disappointment.  
    And your soul? It waits for you to return home.</p>

    <p>When we move, we release. We unlock what we’ve been holding.  
    The body remembers long after the mind has tried to forget.</p>

    <h2>Movement Is Medicine</h2>
    <p>You don’t need a gym or a trainer to experience healing.  
    You just need to move with <strong>intention</strong>.  
    Whether it’s a slow stretch at sunrise, a walk with music, or a sweat-dripping session—it all counts. It all heals.</p>

    <p>Movement gets you out of your head and back into your body.  
    And from that place, you feel more grounded. More clear. More alive.</p>

    <h2>It’s Not About Looking Good — It’s About Feeling Aligned</h2>
    <p>Forget aesthetics for a moment.  
    This isn’t about chasing a six-pack or fitting into some ideal.  
    It’s about checking in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do I feel in my skin today?</li>
      <li>What does my body need to express?</li>
      <li>What emotion is stuck that I can move through?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let movement be your outlet.  
    Let it be your return to center.  
    Let it be your freedom.</p>

    <h2>When You Move, You Shift</h2>
    <p>We’ve all had that moment:  
    You didn’t want to go.  
    You felt stuck.  
    But you moved anyway.  
    And everything changed.</p>

    <p>Your mood lifted.  
    Your thoughts softened.  
    Your energy came back online.</p>

    <p>That’s not coincidence. That’s <strong>connection</strong>. That’s the soul being heard through motion.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Prompts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What emotion is sitting in your body right now?</li>
      <li>When was the last time you moved just for the joy of it?</li>
      <li>What kind of movement makes you feel free, not judged?</li>
      <li>How can you bring more of that movement into your daily life?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Word</h2>
    <p><strong>Movement is not optional. It’s a language.</strong>  
    A way to speak to the deepest parts of you.  
    When you move your body, you move your soul.  
    So move — not because you “should,” but because you <em>must</em>.  
    Because the real you is waiting on the other side of that first step.</p>
